INTRODUCTION  \\nHuman civilization has now entered the era of society 5.0, where it is a continuation of the previous \\nera, namely the era of society 4.0, this is where the era of information and technology is developing rapidly, how \\nthe role of communication and computers plays a very important role in the progress of human civilization. \\nDigital transformation in all lines of life right up to the manufacturing industry by using advanced technology to \\nimprove manufacturing performance [1]. Humans are getting smarter by producing various innovations in \\ntechnology that can make human work easier. The time has come now. namely the e ra of society 5.0, at this \\ntime humans are living side by side with super smart technological innovation [2]. In accordance with Japanese \\ngovernment literature, the era of society 5.0 is an era of society where humans and high technology live side by \\nside to be able to solve problems that exist in social society, with the help of technological innovation that is \\npresent in the era 4.0, it is intended to make humans more prosperous [3]. \\nThe growth of the e -commerce digital economy business is growing rapidly  and developing in the \\ninformation era, namely, where communication and computers are the backbone of the era of society 4.0. The \\ngrowth of the e -commerce business is increasingly advancing with the Covid -19 pandemic experienced by \\nhuman civilization  [4]. During the Covid -19 pandemic, namely a pandemic resulting from an outbreak of a virus \\nthat attacks human resilience and health [5], which results in many human activities experiencing problems and \\nobstacles for anyone exposed to this virus because of its r estrictions on community mobility. Many economic \\nactivities have stopped because it is not possible to meet face to face and so on for fear of being infected by the \\nCovid -19 virus. The e -commerce business is one of the businesses that is very developed and  advanced during \\nthe Covid -19 pandemic. Many female entrepreneurs are doing this business during the Covid -19 period [6], \\nbecause economic transactions between sellers and buyers do not need to meet, Only through communication \\ntools and computers can they carry out economic transactions, where the seller and buyer have an agreement on \\nagreed goods and services.  \\nBased on data from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) 2023, Indonesia's economic growth will \\nincrease from 3.70 percent in 2021 to 5.31 percent in 2022 and the e -commerce business has contributed to \", metadata={'source': 'data/41466639102.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

The growth of e -commerce businesses continues to increase from year \\nto year, according to the Central Statistics Agency (BPS), survey results show that e -commerce b usinesses in \\nIndonesia in 2022 are estimated at 2,995,986 businesses, in 2021 there will be 2,868,178 businesses and in 2021 \\nthere will be 2,868,178 businesses in Previously in 2020 there were 2,361,423 businesses. Only 9.57 percent of \\ne-commerce businesse s have a truly online or digital model and the rest are offline and online e -commerce \\nbusinesses [7]. Based on data collected from BPS in September 2022, e -commerce businesses are only 34.10 \\npercent of conventional businesses, this shows that there are sti ll big opportunities for e -commerce businesses in \\nIndonesia. E -commerce business revenue under 300 million was 82.97 percent [8]. This figure is very promising \\nfor anyone who wants to start an e -commerce business.  \\nBased on data from the Indonesian Internet  Service Providers Association, internet use in Indonesia has \\nalso increased, in 2023 there will be around 215 million users and in the previous year 2022, around 210 \\nmillion. A very significant increase in numbers. The number of Indonesian people connecte d to the internet in \\n2022 -2023 is 215,626,156 people out of the total Indonesian population of 275,773,901 people in 2022. The \\ngender number of internet users is also almost the same, around 50 percent between men and women, only men - \\nThere are fewer men, around 51.19 percent of whom are women  [9]. The use of cell phones and tablets is the \\nmost dominant way to access the internet. Carrying out online transactions is one of the reasons people use the \\ninternet. Internet users range from age 13 -55 years and ab ove and predominantly use cell phones/tablets. \\nEconomy, finance and business are among the contents frequently visited by internet users, other contents are \\nhealth, sports and infotainment.  \\n \\nII.  METHODOLOGY  \\nThis research methodology is qualitative with a lite rature review by collecting previous research related \\nto digital economic business. This research collected a lot of data from literature studies in previous research, \\nthen investigated and studied further and then studied carefully from 45 previous studie s with a time span of \\napproximately 2020 -2024. Businesspeople have been conducting research for years, in order to increase \\nbusiness profits. The need for research in business is increasing as companies realize more opportunities, for \\nexample, in the form of increased global trade and increased competition. Business research is a truth -seeking \\nfunction that is responsible for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and reporting information so that business \\ndecision makers become more effective (Hair et al., 20 20) [10], especially in the era of society 5.0 where digital \\nbusiness is increasingly competitive and dependency will increase. The development of technological \\ninnovation is very necessary because this can support and support and improve human welfare where humans \\nand intelligent machines can live side by side, helping each other and as a community.  \\nIII.  RESULTS  AND  DISCUSSION  \\nHuman civilization has continued to develop since the hunting era, namely early society 1.0, to the era \\nof information technology 4. 0. In the 4.0 era, there are many information technology innovations and in essence \\nhumans cannot live alone because humans are social creatures and need to interact with other humans [11], \\nhuman interaction with other humans results in trade transactions or economic activities aimed at fulfilling each \\nindividual's needs. The 4.0 era is an era where the main foundation for economic modernization, humans and \\nmachines complement each other to achieve synergy in decision making and productivity [12], therefore  the 5.0 \\nera is a continuation for the development of even more sophisticated technology to be able to prosper humanity. \\nTo achieve a sustainable economy in the 5.0 era, there needs to be a stage of technological innovation in the 4.0 \\nera and this is very dependent on information and communication technology [13], this technology is related to \\ncyber security, this attack is an obstacle in the sustainability of economic activities in the 5.0 era.  \\nEncouraging the application of innovative technology in the ma nufacturing sector to make this sector \\neffective and efficient and as a technological foundation that continues to create intelligent and adaptive \\nmanufacturing [14], an ecosystem to support this is created and its sustainability becomes a smart manufactur ing \\necosystem and entered the 5.0 era. The Era of Society 5.0 is closely related to the high technology that existed \\npreviously during the information technology era. This technological innovation has become even more \\nsophisticated due to research and tech nological development which can ultimately be used to solve social \", metadata={'source': 'data/41466639102.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Community social problems are related to the economy, namely the ability to \\nprovide goods and services for consumption in accordance with their needs so that they  are met and the social \\nwelfare of the community is achieved [15]. \\nHuman civilization cannot be separated from economic motives which start from fulfilling individual \\nneeds, hunting, farming, animal husbandry, bartering for these results, then finding proc essing and management \\nmachines to produce products or goods, then finding and developing electrical technology which can become a \\ntool. communication and information, continuing with the development of technological innovation to become \\neven more sophistic ated [16]. In the end, it not only makes human work easier, but also replaces the role of \\nhumans as subjects who do work, so that humans can fulfill their needs and live more prosperously. Startup \\nentrepreneurs can also start their business with an e -comme rce business because the business with low risk at \\nthe financing stage is this e -commerce business [17], an e -commerce business that utilizes applications from the \\nmarket place really requires low costs, because Just download it, you can immediately sell o n the marketplace \\nand run an e -commerce business straight away.  \\nData from surveys from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) and the Indonesian Internet Service \\nProviders Association (APJII) show that internet users and e -commerce businesses in Indonesia con tinue to \\nincrease and this is a very tempting business opportunity for startups and entrepreneurs who are just starting a \\nbusiness. e -commerce. There is a continuous increase in numbers from year to year and there is a large variety \\nof goods, services or p roducts sold in e -commerce businesses and there are still very few people in this business \\ncompared to conventional businesses or non -ecommerce businesses. These things indicate that e -commerce \\nbusiness opportunities are wide open and we have now entered t he era of society 5.0 where humans and super \\nsmart technology coexist to achieve prosperity.  \\nThe development of digital economic business which has existed in the 4.0 era and is developing up to \\nnow in the 5.0 era, when viewed from an Islamic perspective i s that this digital economic business is like e -\\ncommerce, according to the view of Muslim entrepreneurs, it must be ensured that this business must be strict \\nand in accordance with the principles Islamic principles, one of which is that transactions must b e carried out in \\nthe right way, there must be clarity in communication, avoiding interest (Riba) and ensuring that all pillars of \\nIslamic contracts are fulfilled [18], whatever the business, every Muslim entrepreneur must comply with Al - \\nQuran and Hadith, the most important thing is that the intention is only for Allah, not just for the world.  \\nE-commerce business opportunities have entered a year full of hope, starting with the advent of internet \\ncommunication technology in the era of society 4.0 where info rmation technology innovations were discovered, \\ndeveloped and advanced. All lines of life have been affected by this information technology, as well as the \\neconomic sector where economic transactions can be carried out via internet communication technology  [19]. \\nImplementing an e -commerce business can also help the food and beverage business, because this e -commerce \\nbusiness can reach a larger market  [20]. E-commerce business opportunities now target consumers who \\nconsume vegetables and fruit that are still  fresh [21], these consumers need fast, easy, reliable and responsive \\ncommunication, this e -commerce business is the answer.  \\nE-commerce businesses also prioritize trust in order to attract new customers and keep old customers \\n[22]. E-commerce business is n ow even more attractive where there is live streaming to offer products, usually \\ncalled live commerce [23]. This internet communication technology is without obstacles and obstacles, is not \\nbound by time and space, anywhere and at any time you can carry ou t buying and selling transactions, by \\nindividuals or companies. Marketing, promotion and advertising become easier and more affordable, product \\nvariety and reachability of the global market are all important benefits for e -commerce businesses [24]. This e -\\ncommerce business opportunity is very tempting, because it only requires a personal computer or cell phone  and \\ncommunication, so sales or buying and selling transactions can be carried out. The creativity possessed by \\nsellers or e -commerce business people can attract potential buyers and customers. The creativity obtained by e -\\ncommerce business people is due t o information obtained in cyberspace, so that creativity is honed and produces \\ninteresting innovations to attract potential customers. E -commerce business opportunities have been widely \\nresearched and show that this business can minimize expenses, easily c arry out marketing, such as advertising \\nand promotions in cyberspace via social media and other digital marketing [25].

New customers are very valuable, especially new customers who make a lot of transactions. Next, \\nefforts need to be made to retain new customers and retain old customers. In other research related to strategy in \\ne-commerce businesses, there is the importance of reducing costs in this business, because cost efficie ncy will \\nminimize existing capital.  \\nReducing logistics costs in international trade related to the delivery of goods carried out through e -\\ncommerce transactions is very important to increase resource efficiency in the logistics sector  [27]. Emphasis on \\nlogistics costs for long -distance delivery of goods is very important and this is one of the strategies that needs to \\nbe implemented for cost efficiency in e -commerce businesses [28]. Application of technological innovation, \\nintegration of ar tificial intelligence (AI) can influence marketing performance in e -commerce adoption [29], this \\nshows that marketing activities using these factors will make marketing performance better so that it will be able \\nto attract customers to be able to buy produ cts on e -commerce.

Digital \\ntransformation has had an impact on all people's lives, especially the economy, where with digital \\ntransformation, service to customers becomes faster and better, market reach is also more global and bigger \\n[34], digital transformation can also make business becomes more effective and efficient regarding the use of \\nhuman resources and business capital. Competent human resources in this field, namely capabilities in the field \\nof information technology and digital transformation of e -commerce businesses, are still rare and lacking [35], \\nthis can be felt since the beginning of the 4.0 era and is increasingly complex in the era society 5.0. This digital \\nbusiness transformation has also entered the tourism sector where many are offered to promote tourist \\nattractions but virtual tours are made, so that new consumers or new customers are interested in buying tour \\npackages [36], this virtual tour experience is used as promotion before buying a tour package, this is quite \\ninteresting.  \\nThe digital e -commerce business is also related to financia l technology because this is one unit, this \\nfintech innovation is quite troublesome for the banking industry, because it is required to adapt this digital \\nbusiness model, especially regarding payment methods or payment gateways, especially during Covid -19 \\nyesterday [37] fintech innovation has only started since the 4.0 era and continues to innovate in the 5.0 era, the \\ndevelopment of fintech technology is still at an early stage to be more sophisticated, there is a need for deeper \\nresearch into technological  innovation.

This can make customers more loyal to the e -commerce business offered [38]. \\nIn this research, word of mouth or (wom) also has an influence. to commitment, trust and satisfaction so that \\ncustomers remain loyal.

The use of technology in financial institutions has \\nresulted in a greater global market share, especially in the current era. society 5.0. Financial technologies \\n(FinTech) in sharia financial institutions that have developed also have technological risks and this needs to be \\ncarefully considered and considered [42]. The study found that the risk management faced by the sharia \\nfinancial sector when adapting to the di gital era can be divided into two, namely risk mitigation for FinTech that \\nis in accordance with sharia and risk avoidance for innovation that is not in accordance with sharia.

The \\nregulatory framework required to support the ICA needs to include the Islamic Financial Services Act, the sharia \\nsupervisory board, sharia governance standards, and the ICA exchange.

Global Islamic financial institutions are changing along with rapid technological advances. An \\nincreasingly tech -savvy demographic presents both opportunities and challenges for the ind ustry. Advances in \\nmobile technology and FinTech financial technology innovations emerged by combining finance, the Internet, \\nsocial networking services, social media, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analysis [46], FinTech in \\nIslamic finance can improve process efficiency, cost effectiveness, increased distribution, sharia compliance, \\nand financial inclusion.

CONCLUSION  \\nBased on a literature review carried out by collecting and studying previous research, digital economic \\nbusiness opportunities in the era of society 5.0 in Indonesia from an Islamic perspective are very wide open. \\nThis digital business opportuni ty has started since the era of society 4.0 where information and communication \\ntechnology innovation was present. The presence of this technological innovation is still in the early stages and \\nwill be further developed in the era of society 5.0. The massi ve digital business transformation that occurred in \\nthe 4.0 era and the Covid -19 pandemic has become a historical milestone for human civilization in the use of \\nvery intelligent high technology, the era of society 5.0 seems to be progressing faster, from b ig data technology, \\nartificial intelligence, machine learning and expert systems, all these smart technological advances can replace \\nhumans. Humans with their ability to think can create technology that can replace their work, this is in order to \\nimprove t heir lives.  \\n Human welfare is measured by the fulfilment of life's needs in the world. Fulfilling human \\nneeds is closely related to the economy. Humans live dependent on other humans, humans cannot live alone to \\nfulfill their daily needs, so they need to s ocialize to form communities and socialize which ultimately carries out \\neconomic transactions. It is complete that humans are living in the era of society 5.0, where communities live \\nside by side with super smart technology and this is an even bigger busin ess opportunity. Fulfilment of goods \\nand services will become more complex, there will be a lot of new knowledge, because of the many interactions \\nbetween humans and the addition of human interaction with machines.  \\n Indonesia has a lot of manpower and bene fits from a large Muslim population, it can become a \\nmarket share, it can also become a new force in developing digital economic businesses in the world, with a \\nwide variety of products and services offered, especially with sharia -based digital economic bu sinesses. Islam, \\nwhere Islamic rules are very strict regarding economic activities, namely that there are clear and firm rules \\nregarding economic transactions based on the Al -Quran and Hadith. Sharia banking, sharia financial technology, \\ne-commerce and the  halal industry and its ecosystem, what is offered should be free from forms of gambling, \\nopacity and usury or bank interest. Goods and services must be halal and thoyib or contain blessings, so that the \\ngoal of sharia  (maqasid sharia)  is achieved, namely maslahah or inner and outer well -being.  \\n \\nREFERENCES . \\n[1] Mittal, A., Kumar, V., Verma, P., & Singh, A.
