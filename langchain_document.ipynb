Introduction \\n \\nThe global use of modern information and communication technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of \\nThings (IoT), and blockchain technology is hastening the technological and industrial transformation (Salhab et al., 2023).   Artificial intelligence has garnered significant attention from academics, commercial entities, and government bodies \\n(Zhang & Lu, 2021).   The Islamic banking sector, which is the primary element of the Islamic finance industry, has \\nexperienced significant growth since the inception of the first documented experiment in the Egyptian village of Mit Ghamr in 1963.   Currently, there are around 300 Islamic finance institutions operating in 50 economies worldwide, including both \\nMuslim and non-Muslim countries. These organisations collectively hold assets of approximately $1.9 trillion, as reported \\nby the International Financial Services Board in 2016 and the World Bank in 2017.   The Islamic banking sector has several obstacles, one of which is the imperative to use cutting-edge technology in response to the fiercely competitive business \\nenvironment (Al-Fakeh et al., 2020).   Artificial intelligence (AI) is a potent technology with the capacity to transform \\nfinancial reporting practises.   Artificial intelligence (AI) has the capability to automate processes, process large volumes o f \\ndata, and detect patterns that may be overlooked by conventional methods (Y . Zhang et al., 2020).   These functionalities \", metadata={'source': 'data/dsl_2023_60.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

These programmes facilitate the electronic execution of procedures and provide rapid access \\nto financial data and information for both internal and external users, assisting in decision-making (Almaiah, et al., 2022; \\nAlqudah et al., 2023; Lutfi & Alqudah, 2023).  Islamic banks, despite their unique and innovative offerings, are continuously \\nworking to protect their operations, interests, and domestic and international economic activities in line with the growth and \\nongoing advancement of information technologies and their legal obligations.  This is accomplished by the implementation of legal measures, as well as adherence to rules and directives issued by relevant authorities or partnerships, all with the \\noverarching objective of protecting their infrastructure (Sava ş & Karata ş, 2022). \\n1.2    Research Importance \\n1) The research helps to identify how AI can be used to promote ethical and responsible banking practices, ensuring \\ntransparency in decision-making and alignment with Shariah values. \\n2) The research helps to identify the challenges associated with adopting AI in financial reporting practices in Islamic \\nbanks. \\n3) The research can provide recommendations on how to use Artificial Intelligence when using governance standards \\nwithin the Islamic Banking sector. \\n4) The research helps to raise awareness among banks on how to adopt financial reporting quality and accountability. \\n5) The research can provide strategies that can strengthen risk management and fraud detection using Artificial \\nIntelligence. \\n \\n1.3   Research Aim  \\n \\n1) To determine the extent of the impact of Artificial Intelligence as an independent factor on financial reporting \\nquality and accountability in Islamic banking sector. \\n2) To identify the relationship between Artificial intelligence, Islamic banking, and the impact on financial reporting \\nplanning. \\n3) To measure the extent of using Artificial intelligence in Islamic banking sector and using governance standards. \\n4) To identify specific AI-powered solutions that can be implemented to address the unique challenges and \\nopportunities of financial reporting in Islamic banking. \\n5) To examine the ethical considerations and regulatory implications of using artificial intelligence in financial \\nreporting in Islamic banking. \\n2. Theoretical framework and Literature Review  \\n \\nFig. 1.  Theoretical research framework \\n2.1Artificial Intelligence  \\n \\n2.1.1Brief History of Artificial Intelligence  \\n \\nThroughout several decades, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has seen many significant progressions in technology, \\nstudy, and development. Computer scientist John McCarthy first used the term \"artificial intelligence\" in 1956 at the \\nDartmouth Conference, marking the start of AI as a field of research (Haenlein & Kaplan, 2019).  Despite initial excitement, many challenges had to be surmounted before AI research could progress throughout the 1960s and 1970s.  The curtailed \\nallocation of funds towards AI research led to a decline in the overall efforts in the field, sometimes referred to as the “AI \\nwinter” (Chandra & Hareendran, 2021; Haenlein & Kaplan, 2019).  The development of expert systems in the 1980s led to a revival in AI research. These systems replicated human abilities in certain areas by using methods of knowledge \\nrepresentation and inference. Expert systems have shown to be valuable in several fields, such as finance and medicine.   \\n', metadata={'source': 'data/dsl_2023_60.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='H. O. Mbaidin et al.  / Decision Science Letters 13 (2024) \\n 85\\nMachine-learning algorithms gained popularity in the 1990s, allowing AI systems to extract knowledge from data and \\ngradually improve their performance (Ma & Sun, 2020).   The resu rgence of interest in neural networks has greatly propelled \\nthe advancement of artificial intelligence, since they mimic the intricate architecture of the human brain (Park, 2023).   The \\nproliferation of extensive datasets and computational power has fu eled an increase in AI research and the use of AI in many \\nfields over the 21st century (Liu et al., 2018). The breakthroughs in machine learning, particularly in deep learning \\ntechniques, have led to remarkable progress in several domains such as robotics, computer vision, and natural language \\nprocessing.  Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used in several industries such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and  \\nentertainment (Chandra & Hareendran, 2021; Park, 2023). \\n2.1.2 The Artificial Intelligence Concept \\nAdvances in AI have been very beneficial to society and the economy. In addition, it has brought about a new era and \\nsignificantly accelerated societal progress (Hassan et al., 2022; Salhab et al., 2023).  AI is a common abbreviation for the \\nstudy of AI. According to Huang et al. (2019), artificial intelligence is the study of how computers can do tasks often associated with human intelligence.  It facilitates the development of computer systems that can imitate human intelligence \\nand carry out various activities including learning, discernment, and decision-making (Xu, Lu, & Li, 2021).   According to \\nKaplan & Haenlein (2019), artificial intelligence is defined as the ability of a system to effectively comprehend external \\ninput, acquire knowledge from that information, and use that knowledge to adapt itself in a versatile manner to achieve \\ncertain tasks and objectives.   (Dwivedi et al., 2021) provide a definition of artificial intelligence as the increasing capaci ty \\nof computers to do certain tasks and responsibilities that are now fulfilled by humans in both professional and societal \\ncontexts.   (Mikalef & Gupta, 2021) provide an alternative definition, asserting that AI refers to the capacity of a system to \\nrecognise, comprehend, deduce, and acquire knowledge from data in order to accomplish preset objectives for both organisations and society. \\n2.1.3 The Benefits of Artificial Intelligence  \\n \\nThe integration of AI is essential for firms to accurately de termine optimal options for implementing new processes.   \\nEnhancing comprehension of digital resilience facilitates the dissemination of novel ideas in markets and streamlines the \\nattainment of digital innovation by fostering the development of pioneering goods (Zeng et al., 2022).   The adoption of \\nartificial intelligence (AI) refers to the use of AI capabilities and applications, such as computer vision and machine learnin g, \\nto enhance competitive advantages and optimise operational performance (Chatterjee, 2020).   The use of artificial \\nintelligence accelerates innovation in corporate processes by facilitating the creation of new products and improving client services (Wuest et al., 2020).   Moreover, via the utilisation of cutting-edge digital applications, organisations may generate  \\ninnovative concepts that enhance the calibre of their goods and services, while also expediting their ability to adapt to \\nmarket fluctuations (Javaid et al., 2022). \\n2.1.4 Functions of Aritificial Intelligence  \\n \\nIn recent years, the widespread availability of large amounts of data, sophisticated methodologies, and infrastructure have \\nelevated artificial intelligence (AI) to a prominent technological objective for several organisations (Davenport & Ronanki, 2018).   AI encompasses a wide range of tasks such as automation, machine learning, natural language processing, computer \\nvision, visual information interpretation, result prediction, autonomous operation, pattern recognition, personalised experiences, process optimisation, and even assistance in creative pursuits (Sarker, 2022).   Essentially, it revolutionises \\nseveral industries and everyday activities by empowering robots to do tasks, make decisions, and acquire knowledge in a \\nmanner comparable to people (Sarker, 2022). \\n2.1.5 Potential Applications of Artificial Intelligence  \\n \\nTechnology is becoming more prevalent. It alters how people learn, think, and communicate, which has an impact on their \\nlives (Mbaidin et al., 2024). AI is being developed and used in a variety of applications throughout the globe, owing to its symbolic reasoning, adaptability, and explanatory skills (Arrieta et al., 2020). AI has been used in a number of domains, including: \\nHealthCare:  AI is transforming the healthcare business by accelerating drug development, enhancing diagnostics via \\nmedical imaging, and allowing patient-specific therapies (Jiang et al., 2017). It predicts epidemics, streamlines healthcare \\nadministration, and allows for remote patient care via virtual assistants and monitoring (Väänänen et al., 2021). AI aids \\nrobot-assisted surgery, improves data analysis in medical records, and has the potential to totally alter healthcare by improving patient outcomes, accuracy, and efficiency. \\nTransportation: The transportation industry is one of several organisations and businesses that stand to gain from the \\nunprecedented opportunities given by rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) (Abduljabbar et al., 2019). AI is \\ntransforming transportation by enabling self-driving cars, controlling traffic, forecasting maintenance requirements, optimising supply chains, and increasing customer service (Abduljabbar et al., 2019; Iyer, 2021). Artificial intelligence \\nincreases safety, interacts with smart city infrastructure, and aids in environmental impact reduction (Singh et al., 2022). In  \\ngeneral, AI will increase transportation safety, efficiency, and sustainability.  ', metadata={'source': 'data/dsl_2023_60.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='  86\\nLaw: New developments in AI and automation may shake up the foundations of the legal industry and the way services are \\nprovided (Atkinson et al., 2020). Legislators and lawyers alike are taking an interest in AI\\'s potential legal applications, particularly in decision-support systems (AlLouzi & Alomar i, 2023; Mowbray et al., 2020). New ways of creating, \\ndelivering, and capturing value from business operations are being driven by artificial intelligence, machine learning, and \\nautomation in law firms. According to Brooks et al. (2020), \"AI and law\" is incorporating mathematical and computer-based technologies into the legal system with the purpose of making it easier to understand, administer, assist, access, or anticipat e. \\nEducation: The rise of online education has revolutionised teaching methods and opened up new avenues for student \\nlearning (Jawabreh et al., 2023; Nawaiseh, et al, 2021; Wei et al., 2022). The areas of education administration, teaching, \\nand learning, as well as the education sector as individual e ducational institutions, have all been profoundly affected by AI \\n(Chen, Chen, & Lin, 2020). Better or more comprehensive education is the outcome of teachers\\' increased efficacy and \\nefficiency made possible by AI platforms and technologies (Alomari, 2023). The capacity of AI to tailor and personalise educational resources to each student\\'s unique strengths, weaknesses, interests, and learning style has led to enhanced \\neducational opportunities for pupils (Chen, Chen, & Lin, 2020). One of the best options so far has been online education \\n(Mbaidin, 2024).  \\nFinancial institutions: AI is laying a solid foundation for future technological advancement. According to Bredt (2019) \\nand Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2017), AI has the potential to completely transform the financial industry. It will bring about \\nmore personalised and top-notch services, as well as cheaper options and new ways of doing business. There is a growing \\nvariety of AI uses in the banking industry. Financial institutions, insurance companies, and capital markets are using AI for a variety of new business model creation purposes, including automation, analysis, and decision-making. Banks will rely heavily on AI technologies for consumer interactions in the future (Murugesan & Manohar, 2019; Ryll et al., 2020).  \\n2.2 Concept of  Standards in the Islamic banking sector within Artificial Intelligence \\n \\nInformation and communication technology have also facilitated the promotion of governance and facilitated administrative \\nreform (Mbaidin, 2021).   Furthermore, it is widely recognised that providing exceptional e-government services fosters transparency and facilitates public access to government information and services.   These elements enhance public \\nconfidence in the government and reinforce the public sector\\'s involvement in the pursuit of sustainable development (Isaac \\net al., 2017).   Due to advancements in technology, government and organisational leaders are contemplating the adoption of secure and user-friendly technology to ensure accountability (Alqaraleh, et al, 2022; Hayek, et al, 2023; Nawaiseh, et al, \\n2021).   The enhancement of global logistics is an ongoing endeavour, with participation from both public and commercial \\nentities (Mbaidin et al., 2023).   AI governance standards in Islamic banking are derived from many core concepts (Almeida et al., 2021), which encompass:   At first, strict obedience to Islamic law.   In order for Islamic finance to adhere to ethica l \\nand religious principles, AI applications must align with Sharia  laws.   Avoidance of riba, which refers to interest-based \\ntransactions, and other practises that are forbidden by Islamic law is imperative (KILIÇ, 2023; Rabbani, Khan, & Atif, 2023).   The second principle is centred on accountability and openness.   Governance standards prioritise openness in AI \\nalgorithms and decision-making processes to ensure stakeholders have a clear understanding of how AI models operate and \\nmake decisions (Felzmann et al., 2020).   Establishing mechanisms for accountability is crucial in ensuring the ethical use \\nof AI in Islamic finance (Rabbani et al., 2021).   The final classification pertains to Ethical AI.   Islamic banking promotes \\nthe encouragement of AI systems that prioritise social responsibility, justice, and ethical challenges.   This encompasses \\nartificial intelligence models that promote fair lending practises, ethical investing strategies, and the involvement of all \\nindividuals in the financial system (Mhlanga, 2020).   Anot her crucial factor is Human Oversight and competence, since \\ngovernance norms highlight the significance of human supe rvision and competence in the implementation of Islamic \\nbanking.   While AI has the capability to automate processes,  the role of human judgement, knowledge, and ethical reasoning \\nremains crucial, particularly in the application of Sharia rules (Shamdi et al., 2022).   Regulatory compliance ranks sixth in \\nimportance.   Artificial Intelligence endeavours in Islamic banking must conform to suitable regulatory frameworks and regulations.   Regulators are necessary to ensure that AI applications adhere to both ordinary business rules and the \\nrequirements of Islamic finance.    Ultimately, continuous evaluation and surveillance.   AI systems need ongoing monitoring \\nand assessment to ascertain their efficacy, influence, and adherence to Sharia law (KILIÇ, 2023).   This enables the development and maturation of AI applications throughout time.   These rules ensure that AI applications adhere to the principles of Islamic banking, while promoting the ethical and responsible use of technology in the financial sector.  \\n2.3 The critical impact of Artificial intelligence (AI) when using governance standards to adopt financial reporting quality \\nand accountability within the Islamic bank sector in the UAE \\n \\nThe integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the governance requirements of financial reporting may significantly enhance the quality and accountability of reporting in the Islamic banking industry.   Firstly, enhanced efficiency and \\nprecision.   AI-driven automation enhances precision and reduces mistakes in financial reporting processes (Abhishek et al., \\n2023; Ahmad et al., 2024).   This efficacy guarantees precise and prompt financial statements by reducing reporting delays (Al-Hosaini et al., 2023; Ali, Ali, & Fatima, 2023; Saleh¹ et al., 2023).   Another significant effect of artificial intelligen ce \\n(AI) is its ability to facilitate thorough monitoring and auditing of financial transactions. This promotes transparency in \\noperations, thereby enhancing the level of accountability within Islamic banking and contributing to a more efficient economy (Al-Baity, 2023; Jan et al., 2023).   One significant effect is the enforcement of adherence to Islamic financial ', metadata={'source': 'data/dsl_2023_60.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

These algorithms have the capability to examine transactions, contracts, and \\nfinancial data in order to identify any possible concerns about Shariah compliance (Ahmet, 2023).    Furthermore, AI-driven \\nsystems have the capability to incorporate Shariah-compliant offerings into various financial services and products, resulting \\nin increased client happiness, loyalty, and profitability (Elaprolu et al., 2024; Rabbani et al., 2020).   In order to properly  \\nharness AI, it is crucial to establish collaboration between technical innovation and respect to Islamic governance \\nrequirements (Rabbani, 2023).   Implementing regulatory frameworks to oversee IT practises in the banking sector \\nencourages adherence to compliance standards and ethical conduct (Alrabei, Al-Othman, Al-Dalabih, Taber, & Ali, 2022; Binsaddig, Ali, Al-Alkawi, & Ali, 2023).   The use of artificial intelligence into financial reporting criteria in the Islamic \\nbanking sector in the UAE has great potential.   In order to attain effective integration and sustained expansion, it is \\nimperative to establish a harmonious equilibrium between technology progress and compliance with Islamic ethical and governance principles.  \\n2.4 UTAUT Constructs \\nExamining the four parts of UTAUT—Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, and Facilitating \\nConditions—is the main goal of this study.   The goal is to study how Financial Reporting Quality (FRQ) is affected by the \\nadoption and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the Islamic banking industry.  If we want to know how to improve \\nIslamic financial reporting using artificial intelligence, we need  this framework. There are a lot of things that influence how  \\nwell AI is received and used.  In an effort to grasp the intricacies of technology adoption, this study seeks to examine these notions. It sheds light on how Shariah-compliant Islamic financial institutions may make effective use of AI to address \\noperational and compliance requirements. \\n \\n2.4.1 Performance Expectancy (PE) \\n \\nThe comprehension AI deployment in the banking sector is heavily reliant on the concept of Performance Expectancy. This \\nis the extent to which individuals feel that AI will improve their job performance (Venkatesh et al., 2003).   There is a stron g \\nbelief that AI may greatly improve Islamic banking's financial reporting in terms of accuracy and efficiency (Liu et al., \\n2021).   When precision and scrupulous attention to Shariah compliance are paramount, Performance Expectancy becomes \\ncrucial.   Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to enhance financial reporting in many ways, and banking professionals are increasingly inclined to use these technologies (Al Tarawneh, et al., 2023; Shan et al., 2022; Shniekat, et al., 2022; \\nThuneibat, et al., 2022).   Artificial intelligence (AI) is seen as a useful tool within Islamic financial companies due to its  \\npotential to enhance the quality and dependability of financial processes. \\n \\n2.4.2 Effort Expectancy (EE) \\n \\nEffort Expectancy, which refers to the perceived ease of using AI systems, plays a vital role in the acceptance of technology in the Islamic banking industry (Venkatesh et al., 2003).   The extent to which artificial intelligence (AI) is incorporated in to \\nexisting financial reporting processes inside banks may significantly affect the acceptance and use of these technologies.   \\nThe usability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems is very crucial in the Islamic banking industry, since financial \\ntransactions often include intricate processes that must comply with Shariah norms.   Research conducted by Fedorko et al. \\n(2021) indicates that user-friendly technologies are more likely to be adopted and integrated into the regular operations of the banking sector.   Therefore, the perceived degree of exerti on necessary for using AI systems is a critical factor in decidi ng \\ntheir adoption in the context of Islamic banking operations. \\n2.4.3 Social Influence (SI) \\n \\nThe role of social influence on technology adoption is well recognised, particularly in professional situations such as Islamic  \\nbanking (Venkatesh et al., 2003). This notation indicates how much people believe their use of AI in financial reporting is \\nimpacted by the thoughts and opinions of their colleagues and industry leaders. The backing and acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies by respected persons in the Islamic banking business has the ability to dramatically influence \\nbanking professionals' perceptions and adoption of these technologies. According to Cugurullo and Acheampong (2023), \\nthe adoption of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), in the area of financial reporting is heavily impacted by social factors, such as the viewpoints of colleagues and prevalent business trends. \\n2.4.4 Facilitating Conditions (FC) \\n \\nFacilitating Conditions refer to the degree to which persons believe that there is a well-established organisational and \\ntechnological structure in place to support the use of AI systems (Venkatesh et al., 2003).   The effective integration of \\nartificial intelligence (AI) in financial reporting in the Islamic banking industry is highly dependent on the existence of a dependable IT infrastructure, comprehensive technical support, and specialised training resources.   The existence of these \\ncriteria is vital for the successful adoption and effective utilisation of artificial intelligence (AI), especially in activiti es that \\nmust comply with Shariah principles.   Lee and Chen (2022) have shown via academic research that the presence of enabling infrastructure and resources is crucial for successfully incorporating technology in many sectors, including the banking \\nindustry.   Therefore, the presence of enough facilitating factors is essential for the successful integration of artificial \\nintelligence (AI) in the context of Islamic banking. \", metadata={'source': 'data/dsl_2023_60.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"  88\\n2.4.5 Behavioural Intention (BI) \\n \\nIslamic banking behavioural Intention (BI) in the realm of technology adoption, particularly in the field of Islamic banking, \\npertains to the propensity of banking professionals to use artif icial intelligence (AI) in their financial reporting duties.  T he \\ncited construct is a crucial component of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework, \\nsince it incorporates the influential factors that affect an individual's decision to accept a technology (Venkatesh et al., 20 03).  \\nIn the field of Islamic banking, the combination of business intelligence (BI) and artificial intelligence (AI) is influenced by professionals' opinions on the usefulness  and ease of use of AI, as well as the le vel of support they receive from society \\nand their organisation (Venkatesh & Bala, 2008).  The use of AI technology is very important in the context of Islamic \\nbanking, since it is necessary to guarantee compliance with Shariah rules and has the ability to improve accuracy and efficiency in financial reporting.   Prior studies have shown that a strong propensity for using artificial intelligence (AI) m ay \\nlead to the effective adoption and successful use of AI in  enhancing financial reporting processes (Saxena, 2022). \\n2.4.6 Use Behaviour (UB) \\n \\nWhen it comes to applying AI to the banking sector, the idea of Use Behaviour (UB) is fundamental to the UTAUT paradigm.   \\nThis concept goes beyond mere intent and includes the practical use of AI technology to financial reporting processes \\n(Venkatesh et al., 2003).   Utilising UB highlights the proactive and effective integration of AI into routine financial \\noperations, going beyond just contemplation or planning.  \\nAI is being used by Islamic banks to do financial analyses, assess risks, and report on compliance, all in accordance with \\nShariah law. This is proof that the industry has done a masterful job of incorporating this new technology.   A crucial step in moving from theoretical acceptance of AI to practical and value-enhancing actions is the shift from Behavioural Intention (BI) to Use Behaviour (UB).  \\nMany major elements must be considered for the use of AI to Islamic financial reporting to be a success.  Among them, one \\nmay find user-centric AI technologies' usability, institutional endorsement, and supplementary resources, in addition to an individual's natural tendency (Saxena, 2022).   This emphasises the need of making sure AI technologies are available and \\ncustomised to suit the unique requirements of Islamic financial reporting.   Ethical frameworks, internal control systems, \\nand the influence on financial performance are just a few of the variables that must be carefully considered when using AI \\nfor financial reporting (Al-Dmour et al., 2018).  It is crucial to highlight the significance of AI systems' usability in finan cial \\nreporting since it impacts users' decision-making and the technology's overall efficacy (Talamo et al., 2021).  Furthermore, \\nwhile using AI, a customised strategy is required due to the specific circumstances surrounding Islamic financial reporting. According to Mukhlisin (2021), this strategy has to take Islamic finance's unique standards and principles into account. \\n2.5 Research Hypothesis and Model Development A modified version of the UTAUT paradigm is used in this study in order to explore the ways in which Islamic banks are \\nusing AI and the ways in which it is impacting financial reporting quality (FRQ).   When it comes to gaining a knowledge \\nof the behaviours that are associated with the adoption of technology, the UTAUT model offers an outstanding theoretical framework that has been validated in a number of different fields.

Each construct is represented by four indicators in this research, in line with the accepted techniques \\nof analysis utilising Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). All items within the constructs of \\nBehavioural Intention (BI), Effort Expectancy (EE), Facilitating Conditions (FC), Financial Reporting Quality (FRQ), Performance Expectancy (PE), Social Influence (SI), and Use Behaviour (UB) demonstrate robust and statistically significant loadings. \\nTable 2 presents the range of values for each item within the constructs of Behavioral Intention (BI1-BI4), Effort Expectancy \\n(EE1-EE4), Facilitating Conditions (FC1-FC4), Financial Reporting Quality (FRQ1-FRQ4), Performance Expectancy (PE1-PE4), Social Influence (SI1-SI4), and Use Behavior (UB1 -UB4). The values range from 0.763 to 0.844 for Behavioral \\nIntention, 0.858 to 0.880 for Effort Expectancy, 0.847 to 0.871 for Facilitating Conditions, 0.728 to 0.835 for Financial \\nReporting Quality, 0.829 to 0.876 for Performance Expectancy, 0.856 to 0.872 for Social Influence, and 0.830 to 0.903 for Use Behavior. These loadings indicate satisfactory results and provide justification for including all items in subsequent \\nanalyses. \\n4.1.2 Reliability \\n \\nTable 2 demonstrates that all constructions have Cronbach's alpha values greater than 0.7, indicating high levels of internal \\nconsistency. As an example, the construct of Behavioural Intention (BI) has a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.799, suggesting that the questions used to test BI have a high degree of internal consistency. All constructs' composite reliability scores \\n(rho_a and rho_c) exceed the required threshold of 0.7, suggesting that the constructs are very reliable. The construct of \\nEffort Expectancy (EE) has a high composite reliability, as shown by a rho_a of 0.899 and a rho_c of 0.925. These data imply that this construct's measurement is exact. \\n4.1.3 Validity \\n \\nAll constructs have Average Variance Extracted (A VE) values that are above the criterion of 0.5, thereby demonstrating \\nconvergent validity.   For instance, the mean explained variance (A VE) for Social Influence (SI) is 0.752, suggesting that, \\non average, the construct explains 75.2% of the observed variation in its indicators.

This finding provides \\nconfirmation that the items categorized inside each construct are effectively assessing the identical underlying notion. \\n4.1.4 Collinearity Statistics (VIF) \\n \\nThe evaluation of multicollinearity holds significant importance within the context of PLS-SEM analysis. This practice \\nassures that the indicator variables incorporated in the model exhibit minimal correlation, hence safeguarding the integrity \\nof the research outcomes. The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is a commonly employed metric for assessing the presence of multicollinearity in statistical models. According to (Hair et al., 2017), VIF values that surpass 5 indicate the possibilit y \\nof encountering a multicollinearity issue. \\nThe VIF values for all variables in this dataset are significantly lower than the frequently accepted threshold of 5, suggestin g \\nthat multicollinearity is not a significant issue. The maximum observed VIF value is 2.974 (for UB2), which is far below the threshold, indicating that the indicators in the model exhibit a rather high level of independence. The measurement model demonstrates the absence of collinearity concerns, as seen by the lowest VIF score of 1.414 (for FRQ4). \\n4.1.5 R-square Values \\n \\nThe suggested model accurately explains a significant portion of the variation seen in the three internal constructs, namely \\nBI, UB, and FRQ.   Specifically:  \\nThe R-squared score of 0.869 indicates that about 86.9% of the variation in Behavioural Intention (BI) can be explained by \\nthe components of Perceived Ease of Use (PE), Perceived Enjo yment (EE), and Social Influence (SI).   The significant size \\nof this number suggests that the factors contributing to business intelligence are well-represented in the model.   The \\ndeclaration emphasises the notable influence of performance expectations, effort beliefs, and societal pressures on the desire to use artificial intelligence (AI) for financial reporting in the specific context of Islamic banking.   The R-squared score o f \\n0.869 indicates that about 86.9% of the variation in Behavioural Intention (BI) can be explained by the components of \\nPerceived Enjoyment (PE), Perceived Ease of Use (EE), and Social Influence (SI).   The significant size of this number suggests that the factors contributing to business intelligence are appropriately included in the model.   This statement \\nemphasises the considerable influence of performance expectations, effort perceptions, and societal pressures on the desire \\nto use artificial intelligence (AI) for financial reporting in the specific context of Islamic banking.  \\nThe R-squared value of 0.871 indicates that 87.1% of the variation in Use Behaviour (UB) can be accounted for by the \\ncombined impact of Business Intelligence (BI) and Financial Control (FC).   This discovery emphasises the importance of \\nboth the desire to use artificial intelligence (AI) and the variables that facilitate such use, as they greatly reflect the fut ure \\nbehaviour of using AI.   This research investigates the extent to which professionals in the Islamic banking industry successfully use artificial intelligence (AI) technology, depending on favourable conditions.  \\nThe R-squared value of 0.822 achieved for Financial Reporting Quality (FRQ) indicates that the model adequately captures \\na substantial percentage (82.2%) of the observed variation in FR Q.   This indicates that the perception or experience of the \\nquality of financial reporting by experts in Islamic banking is greatly affected by their use of AI technologies.  \\n4.2 Hypotheses Testing \\nTable 3 and Fig. 3 shows that a Test the proposed hypotheses by analyzing the path coefficients and corresponding p-values \\nfrom the bootstrap results. \\nTable 3  \\nHypotheses Testing \\nH Path Original \\nsample (O) Sample \\nmean (M) Standard deviation \\n(STDEV) T statistics \\n(|O/STDEV |) P values Decision  \\nH1  (PE) → (BI) 0.374 0.374 0.026 14.588 0.000 Accepted \\nH2  (EE) → (BI) 0.501 0.501 0.026 19.656 0.000 Accepted \\nH3  (SI) → (BI) 0.759 0.758 0.025 30.821 0.000 Accepted \\nH4  (FC) → (UB) 0.458 0.458 0.024 18.851 0.000 Accepted \\nH5  (BI) → (UB) 0.767 0.767 0.021 35.963 0.000 Accepted \\nH6  (UB) → (FRQ) 0.937 0.938 0.033 28.429 0.000 Accepted \\nH7  (BI) → (FRQ) -0.038 -0.039 0.039 0.960 0.337 Not Accepted \\n \\nThe results obtained from the PLS-SEM analysis have provided valuable insights on the acceptability and impact of \\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) in the Islamic banking sector, as suggested by the Unified Theory of acceptability and Use of \\nTechnology (UTAUT) framework.

The  \\nresearch found that the existence of Facilitating Conditions (FC) positively influences Use Behaviour (UB), suggesting that \\nthe provision of necessary resources and infrastructure greatly improves the utilisation of artificial intelligence (AI).   \\nTherefore, the concept of behavioural intention (BI) is a reliable predictor of ultimate behaviour (UB), confirming that the professed desire to use artificial intelligence (AI) indicates future involvement in actual use activities.   An important \\ndiscovery is the presence of a strong and reliable positive correlation between Use Behaviour (UB) and Financial Reporting \\nQuality (FRQ). This suggests that the efficient application of artificial intelligence (AI) is widely recognised as a significa nt \\nfactor in enhancing the overall standard of financial reporting.   However, the lack of empirical data establishing a clear \\nconnection between business intelligence (BI) and the quality of financial reporting (FRQ) suggests that just intending to \\nuse artificial intelligence (AI) is not enough to improve FRQ.   Conversely, the practical use of AI acts as an intermediary \\nin attaining enhanced FRQ.   The findings confirm that the UTAUT model is suitable for understanding the elements that \\nimpact the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in Islamic banking.   Furthermore, they highlight the vital importance of real-world use behaviour in attaining the benefits of AI in improving the quality of financial reporting. \\n4.3 Indirect Effects Path \\n \\nTable 4 presents the unique indirect effects within the PLS-SEM model, focusing on the UTAUT-based framework.

The observation that social influence (SI) exerts a significant impact on \\nbehavioural intention (BI) may be attributed to cultural or organizational attributes unique to the Islamic banking industry, which places great importance on community perspectives and collaborative decision-making. The robust correlation \\nbetween UB (University of Berkeley) and FRQ (Frequentist Regression Quantification) highlights the tangible ramifications \\nof artificial intelligence (AI) utilization. The proposition posits that the advantages of artificial intelligence (AI) are mos t \\nperceptible when these technologies are actively included into routine financial reporting processes, as opposed to being \\nmerely accessible as an alternative. This emphasizes the significance of engaging in direct interaction with technology to \\nfully harness its potential for improving the quality of reporting. The absence of a straightforward correlation between Business Intelligence (BI) and Free Response Question (FRQ) points highlights the intricate nature of transforming \\nintentions into results. This implies that there may be additional variables, such as the way the technology is implemented \\nor the user's level of expertise with artificial intelligence, that could influence the extent to which enhanced reporting qual ity \\nis achieved. This discovery presents novel opportunities for further investigation into the obstacles that may impede the \\ntranslation of intentions into successful utilization. \\nThe findings of the investigation provide empirical evidence supporting the notion that use behaviour plays a crucial \\nintermediary role in the relationship between behavioural intention and the quality of financial reporting. Although \\nbehavioural intention is a crucial factor preceding use behaviour, it does not autonomously enhance financial reporting \\nquality without the practical implementation of AI technologies. The utilization of the UTAUT model confirms the theoretical premises that behavioural intention is substantially influenced by social impact and effort expectancy, hence \\npredicting use behaviour. Nevertheless, the direct influence of performance expectancy on the quality of financial reporting \\njust through behavioural intention is not substantiated, suggesting that the actual utilization of artificial intelligence is c rucial \\nfor reaping its advantages. The presence of facilitating conditions is a crucial factor in facilitating the utilization of arti ficial \\nintelligence (AI), hence resulting in enhanced quality of financial reporting. The findings underscore the intricate \\nrelationship between behavioural, social, and enabling elements in the implementation and proficient utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) within the context of Islamic banking. This underscores the significance of practical implementation in attaining the intended results. \\n6. Conclusion  \\n \\nThe incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the Islamic banking industry has presented significant ramifications for \\nthe integrity of financial reporting and control. The UTAUT model has played a crucial role in assessing the factors that \\ninfluence the acceptance and efficient utilization of artificial intelligence. The results of the study, as determined using PL S-\\nSEM, provide support for the effectiveness of the model in accurately representing the complexities associated with the \\nadoption and utilization of technology. These insights hold significant importance for professionals and decision-makers in \\nthe field of Islamic banking, offering a detailed comprehension of the primary factors that contribute to the effective \\nintegration of artificial intelligence. The confluence of artificial intelligence (AI) with governance norms holds significant revolutionary potential for the Islamic banking sector. According to Khan (2019), the utilization of artificial intelligence \\n(AI) plays a crucial role in improving the precision, comprehensiveness, and punctuality of financial reporting. This is \\nachieved through the facilitation of automated processes for intricate activities, the provision of advanced data analytics capabilities, and the support for adherence to Shariah principles. In addition to enhancing the quality of reporting, the \\nutilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in real-time monitoring and risk management corresponds to the stringent \\nrequirements of Shariah compliance and ethical banking (Rahim et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the research could not find \\nevidence to establish the direct correlation between Behavioural Intention and Financial Reporting Quality. This suggests a \\nmore complex mechanism in which the actual behaviour of using a product or service plays a crucial role in mediating the relationship between intention and improved reporting results. This implies that the mere intention to utilize artificial \\nintelligence (AI) is insufficient for enhancing quality; rather, it is the practical implementation and integration of AI into \\neveryday operations that result in measurable advancements. Essentially, the UTAUT model states that practical use, which is affected by behavioural intentions and made easier by favourable conditions, is what really matters when it comes to \\nartificial intelligence (AI) advantages. Since AI has the ability to improve governance norms, it might have significant \\nbenefits for Islamic institutions. But it's critical to make sure that Islamic ethics and governance systems don't clash with technological advancements. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) by Islamic banks might lead to more openness, \\nresponsibility, and moral business dealings. Because of this, confidence and trust may grow among different parties \\ninvolved. A balanced approach that recognises the importance of technological advancements while maintaining the core principles of Islamic finance is necessary for the successful integration of AI into the framework of financial reporting and governance within the Islamic banking sector. \\n7. Future Directions \\n \\nFor this research, it is necessary to examine the mechanisms that facilitate the conversion of intents into effective utilisati on \\nof AI.   Additional research is required to ascertain the potential obstacles and advantages linked to the use of AI technology  \\nin an Islamic banking context.   Further investigation is required to examine the potential connections between the \\ngovernance criteria of Islamic financial institutions and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI).   This investigation  \\naims to improve both the financial reporting quality and the overall governance framework of these organisations.  \", metadata={'source': 'data/dsl_2023_60.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",

This might not be ideal if you want to track where each piece of information comes from within the CSV.You can specify a column name within your CSV file using source_column.

By having individual source information for each Document, these chains can consider the origin of the data while processing and potentially provide more nuanced or reliable answers.UnstructuredCSVLoaderUnlike CSVLoader, which treats each row as a separate document with headers defining the data, in UnstructuredCSVLoader, the entire CSV file is considered a single “Unstructured Table” element.

INTRODUCTION  \\nHuman civilization has now entered the era of society 5.0, where it is a continuation of the previous \\nera, namely the era of society 4.0, this is where the era of information and technology is developing rapidly, how \\nthe role of communication and computers plays a very important role in the progress of human civilization. \\nDigital transformation in all lines of life right up to the manufacturing industry by using advanced technology to \\nimprove manufacturing performance [1]. Humans are getting smarter by producing various innovations in \\ntechnology that can make human work easier. The time has come now. namely the e ra of society 5.0, at this \\ntime humans are living side by side with super smart technological innovation [2]. In accordance with Japanese \\ngovernment literature, the era of society 5.0 is an era of society where humans and high technology live side by \\nside to be able to solve problems that exist in social society, with the help of technological innovation that is \\npresent in the era 4.0, it is intended to make humans more prosperous [3]. \\nThe growth of the e -commerce digital economy business is growing rapidly  and developing in the \\ninformation era, namely, where communication and computers are the backbone of the era of society 4.0. The \\ngrowth of the e -commerce business is increasingly advancing with the Covid -19 pandemic experienced by \\nhuman civilization  [4]. During the Covid -19 pandemic, namely a pandemic resulting from an outbreak of a virus \\nthat attacks human resilience and health [5], which results in many human activities experiencing problems and \\nobstacles for anyone exposed to this virus because of its r estrictions on community mobility. Many economic \\nactivities have stopped because it is not possible to meet face to face and so on for fear of being infected by the \\nCovid -19 virus. The e -commerce business is one of the businesses that is very developed and  advanced during \\nthe Covid -19 pandemic. Many female entrepreneurs are doing this business during the Covid -19 period [6], \\nbecause economic transactions between sellers and buyers do not need to meet, Only through communication \\ntools and computers can they carry out economic transactions, where the seller and buyer have an agreement on \\nagreed goods and services.  \\nBased on data from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) 2023, Indonesia's economic growth will \\nincrease from 3.70 percent in 2021 to 5.31 percent in 2022 and the e -commerce business has contributed to \", metadata={'source': 'data/41466639102.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

The growth of e -commerce businesses continues to increase from year \\nto year, according to the Central Statistics Agency (BPS), survey results show that e -commerce b usinesses in \\nIndonesia in 2022 are estimated at 2,995,986 businesses, in 2021 there will be 2,868,178 businesses and in 2021 \\nthere will be 2,868,178 businesses in Previously in 2020 there were 2,361,423 businesses. Only 9.57 percent of \\ne-commerce businesse s have a truly online or digital model and the rest are offline and online e -commerce \\nbusinesses [7]. Based on data collected from BPS in September 2022, e -commerce businesses are only 34.10 \\npercent of conventional businesses, this shows that there are sti ll big opportunities for e -commerce businesses in \\nIndonesia. E -commerce business revenue under 300 million was 82.97 percent [8]. This figure is very promising \\nfor anyone who wants to start an e -commerce business.  \\nBased on data from the Indonesian Internet  Service Providers Association, internet use in Indonesia has \\nalso increased, in 2023 there will be around 215 million users and in the previous year 2022, around 210 \\nmillion. A very significant increase in numbers. The number of Indonesian people connecte d to the internet in \\n2022 -2023 is 215,626,156 people out of the total Indonesian population of 275,773,901 people in 2022. The \\ngender number of internet users is also almost the same, around 50 percent between men and women, only men - \\nThere are fewer men, around 51.19 percent of whom are women  [9]. The use of cell phones and tablets is the \\nmost dominant way to access the internet. Carrying out online transactions is one of the reasons people use the \\ninternet. Internet users range from age 13 -55 years and ab ove and predominantly use cell phones/tablets. \\nEconomy, finance and business are among the contents frequently visited by internet users, other contents are \\nhealth, sports and infotainment.  \\n \\nII.  METHODOLOGY  \\nThis research methodology is qualitative with a lite rature review by collecting previous research related \\nto digital economic business. This research collected a lot of data from literature studies in previous research, \\nthen investigated and studied further and then studied carefully from 45 previous studie s with a time span of \\napproximately 2020 -2024. Businesspeople have been conducting research for years, in order to increase \\nbusiness profits. The need for research in business is increasing as companies realize more opportunities, for \\nexample, in the form of increased global trade and increased competition. Business research is a truth -seeking \\nfunction that is responsible for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and reporting information so that business \\ndecision makers become more effective (Hair et al., 20 20) [10], especially in the era of society 5.0 where digital \\nbusiness is increasingly competitive and dependency will increase. The development of technological \\ninnovation is very necessary because this can support and support and improve human welfare where humans \\nand intelligent machines can live side by side, helping each other and as a community.  \\nIII.  RESULTS  AND  DISCUSSION  \\nHuman civilization has continued to develop since the hunting era, namely early society 1.0, to the era \\nof information technology 4. 0. In the 4.0 era, there are many information technology innovations and in essence \\nhumans cannot live alone because humans are social creatures and need to interact with other humans [11], \\nhuman interaction with other humans results in trade transactions or economic activities aimed at fulfilling each \\nindividual's needs. The 4.0 era is an era where the main foundation for economic modernization, humans and \\nmachines complement each other to achieve synergy in decision making and productivity [12], therefore  the 5.0 \\nera is a continuation for the development of even more sophisticated technology to be able to prosper humanity. \\nTo achieve a sustainable economy in the 5.0 era, there needs to be a stage of technological innovation in the 4.0 \\nera and this is very dependent on information and communication technology [13], this technology is related to \\ncyber security, this attack is an obstacle in the sustainability of economic activities in the 5.0 era.  \\nEncouraging the application of innovative technology in the ma nufacturing sector to make this sector \\neffective and efficient and as a technological foundation that continues to create intelligent and adaptive \\nmanufacturing [14], an ecosystem to support this is created and its sustainability becomes a smart manufactur ing \\necosystem and entered the 5.0 era. The Era of Society 5.0 is closely related to the high technology that existed \\npreviously during the information technology era. This technological innovation has become even more \\nsophisticated due to research and tech nological development which can ultimately be used to solve social \", metadata={'source': 'data/41466639102.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Community social problems are related to the economy, namely the ability to \\nprovide goods and services for consumption in accordance with their needs so that they  are met and the social \\nwelfare of the community is achieved [15]. \\nHuman civilization cannot be separated from economic motives which start from fulfilling individual \\nneeds, hunting, farming, animal husbandry, bartering for these results, then finding proc essing and management \\nmachines to produce products or goods, then finding and developing electrical technology which can become a \\ntool. communication and information, continuing with the development of technological innovation to become \\neven more sophistic ated [16]. In the end, it not only makes human work easier, but also replaces the role of \\nhumans as subjects who do work, so that humans can fulfill their needs and live more prosperously. Startup \\nentrepreneurs can also start their business with an e -comme rce business because the business with low risk at \\nthe financing stage is this e -commerce business [17], an e -commerce business that utilizes applications from the \\nmarket place really requires low costs, because Just download it, you can immediately sell o n the marketplace \\nand run an e -commerce business straight away.  \\nData from surveys from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) and the Indonesian Internet Service \\nProviders Association (APJII) show that internet users and e -commerce businesses in Indonesia con tinue to \\nincrease and this is a very tempting business opportunity for startups and entrepreneurs who are just starting a \\nbusiness. e -commerce. There is a continuous increase in numbers from year to year and there is a large variety \\nof goods, services or p roducts sold in e -commerce businesses and there are still very few people in this business \\ncompared to conventional businesses or non -ecommerce businesses. These things indicate that e -commerce \\nbusiness opportunities are wide open and we have now entered t he era of society 5.0 where humans and super \\nsmart technology coexist to achieve prosperity.  \\nThe development of digital economic business which has existed in the 4.0 era and is developing up to \\nnow in the 5.0 era, when viewed from an Islamic perspective i s that this digital economic business is like e -\\ncommerce, according to the view of Muslim entrepreneurs, it must be ensured that this business must be strict \\nand in accordance with the principles Islamic principles, one of which is that transactions must b e carried out in \\nthe right way, there must be clarity in communication, avoiding interest (Riba) and ensuring that all pillars of \\nIslamic contracts are fulfilled [18], whatever the business, every Muslim entrepreneur must comply with Al - \\nQuran and Hadith, the most important thing is that the intention is only for Allah, not just for the world.  \\nE-commerce business opportunities have entered a year full of hope, starting with the advent of internet \\ncommunication technology in the era of society 4.0 where info rmation technology innovations were discovered, \\ndeveloped and advanced. All lines of life have been affected by this information technology, as well as the \\neconomic sector where economic transactions can be carried out via internet communication technology  [19]. \\nImplementing an e -commerce business can also help the food and beverage business, because this e -commerce \\nbusiness can reach a larger market  [20]. E-commerce business opportunities now target consumers who \\nconsume vegetables and fruit that are still  fresh [21], these consumers need fast, easy, reliable and responsive \\ncommunication, this e -commerce business is the answer.  \\nE-commerce businesses also prioritize trust in order to attract new customers and keep old customers \\n[22]. E-commerce business is n ow even more attractive where there is live streaming to offer products, usually \\ncalled live commerce [23]. This internet communication technology is without obstacles and obstacles, is not \\nbound by time and space, anywhere and at any time you can carry ou t buying and selling transactions, by \\nindividuals or companies. Marketing, promotion and advertising become easier and more affordable, product \\nvariety and reachability of the global market are all important benefits for e -commerce businesses [24]. This e -\\ncommerce business opportunity is very tempting, because it only requires a personal computer or cell phone  and \\ncommunication, so sales or buying and selling transactions can be carried out. The creativity possessed by \\nsellers or e -commerce business people can attract potential buyers and customers. The creativity obtained by e -\\ncommerce business people is due t o information obtained in cyberspace, so that creativity is honed and produces \\ninteresting innovations to attract potential customers. E -commerce business opportunities have been widely \\nresearched and show that this business can minimize expenses, easily c arry out marketing, such as advertising \\nand promotions in cyberspace via social media and other digital marketing [25].

New customers are very valuable, especially new customers who make a lot of transactions. Next, \\nefforts need to be made to retain new customers and retain old customers. In other research related to strategy in \\ne-commerce businesses, there is the importance of reducing costs in this business, because cost efficie ncy will \\nminimize existing capital.  \\nReducing logistics costs in international trade related to the delivery of goods carried out through e -\\ncommerce transactions is very important to increase resource efficiency in the logistics sector  [27]. Emphasis on \\nlogistics costs for long -distance delivery of goods is very important and this is one of the strategies that needs to \\nbe implemented for cost efficiency in e -commerce businesses [28]. Application of technological innovation, \\nintegration of ar tificial intelligence (AI) can influence marketing performance in e -commerce adoption [29], this \\nshows that marketing activities using these factors will make marketing performance better so that it will be able \\nto attract customers to be able to buy produ cts on e -commerce.

Competent human resources in this field, namely capabilities in the field \\nof information technology and digital transformation of e -commerce businesses, are still rare and lacking [35], \\nthis can be felt since the beginning of the 4.0 era and is increasingly complex in the era society 5.0. This digital \\nbusiness transformation has also entered the tourism sector where many are offered to promote tourist \\nattractions but virtual tours are made, so that new consumers or new customers are interested in buying tour \\npackages [36], this virtual tour experience is used as promotion before buying a tour package, this is quite \\ninteresting.  \\nThe digital e -commerce business is also related to financia l technology because this is one unit, this \\nfintech innovation is quite troublesome for the banking industry, because it is required to adapt this digital \\nbusiness model, especially regarding payment methods or payment gateways, especially during Covid -19 \\nyesterday [37] fintech innovation has only started since the 4.0 era and continues to innovate in the 5.0 era, the \\ndevelopment of fintech technology is still at an early stage to be more sophisticated, there is a need for deeper \\nresearch into technological  innovation.

This can make customers more loyal to the e -commerce business offered [38]. \\nIn this research, word of mouth or (wom) also has an influence. to commitment, trust and satisfaction so that \\ncustomers remain loyal.

The use of technology in financial institutions has \\nresulted in a greater global market share, especially in the current era. society 5.0. Financial technologies \\n(FinTech) in sharia financial institutions that have developed also have technological risks and this needs to be \\ncarefully considered and considered [42]. The study found that the risk management faced by the sharia \\nfinancial sector when adapting to the di gital era can be divided into two, namely risk mitigation for FinTech that \\nis in accordance with sharia and risk avoidance for innovation that is not in accordance with sharia.

The \\nregulatory framework required to support the ICA needs to include the Islamic Financial Services Act, the sharia \\nsupervisory board, sharia governance standards, and the ICA exchange.

CONCLUSION  \\nBased on a literature review carried out by collecting and studying previous research, digital economic \\nbusiness opportunities in the era of society 5.0 in Indonesia from an Islamic perspective are very wide open. \\nThis digital business opportuni ty has started since the era of society 4.0 where information and communication \\ntechnology innovation was present. The presence of this technological innovation is still in the early stages and \\nwill be further developed in the era of society 5.0. The massi ve digital business transformation that occurred in \\nthe 4.0 era and the Covid -19 pandemic has become a historical milestone for human civilization in the use of \\nvery intelligent high technology, the era of society 5.0 seems to be progressing faster, from b ig data technology, \\nartificial intelligence, machine learning and expert systems, all these smart technological advances can replace \\nhumans. Humans with their ability to think can create technology that can replace their work, this is in order to \\nimprove t heir lives.  \\n Human welfare is measured by the fulfilment of life's needs in the world. Fulfilling human \\nneeds is closely related to the economy. Humans live dependent on other humans, humans cannot live alone to \\nfulfill their daily needs, so they need to s ocialize to form communities and socialize which ultimately carries out \\neconomic transactions. It is complete that humans are living in the era of society 5.0, where communities live \\nside by side with super smart technology and this is an even bigger busin ess opportunity. Fulfilment of goods \\nand services will become more complex, there will be a lot of new knowledge, because of the many interactions \\nbetween humans and the addition of human interaction with machines.  \\n Indonesia has a lot of manpower and bene fits from a large Muslim population, it can become a \\nmarket share, it can also become a new force in developing digital economic businesses in the world, with a \\nwide variety of products and services offered, especially with sharia -based digital economic bu sinesses. Islam, \\nwhere Islamic rules are very strict regarding economic activities, namely that there are clear and firm rules \\nregarding economic transactions based on the Al -Quran and Hadith. Sharia banking, sharia financial technology, \\ne-commerce and the  halal industry and its ecosystem, what is offered should be free from forms of gambling, \\nopacity and usury or bank interest. Goods and services must be halal and thoyib or contain blessings, so that the \\ngoal of sharia  (maqasid sharia)  is achieved, namely maslahah or inner and outer well -being.  \\n \\nREFERENCES . \\n[1] Mittal, A., Kumar, V., Verma, P., & Singh, A.
