       "'Nice to meet you, Safeer!\\n\\nAs for your question, the best language to start writing code depends on several factors, such as:\\n\\n1. Your goals: Are you interested in web development, mobile app development, data analysis, or something else?\\n2. Your experience: Have you worked with programming concepts before, or are you a complete beginner?\\n3. The type of projects: Do you want to build games, chatbots, or something more complex?\\n\\nThat being said, here are some popular languages that are great for beginners:\\n\\n1. **Python**: Known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use, Python is an excellent choice for beginners. It\\'s also a versatile language with applications in web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more.\\n2. **JavaScript**: As the primary language for web development, JavaScript is a great choice if you want to build interactive web pages, work on client-side scripting, or create web applications. Node.js allows you to use JavaScript for server-side programming as well.\\n3. **HTML/CSS**: Not a programming language per se, but essential for building websites and web applications. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used for structuring content, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling and layout.\\n4. **Java**: A popular language for beginners, Java is known for its platform independence, making it a great choice for Android app development or building enterprise-level applications.\\n5. **Swift**: If you\\'re interested in iOS or macOS app development, Swift is the way to go. It\\'s an easy-to-learn language with a lot of built-in features and a growing community.\\n\\nRemember, there\\'s no single \"best\" language for beginners. The most important thing is to choose a language that aligns with your goals and interests, and to have fun learning!\\n\\nWhat do you think? Which language are you leaning towards, or would you like me to suggest some resources to help you get started?'"
